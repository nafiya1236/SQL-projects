# SQL-PROJECTS
**SQL project on hospital adminstration**
[Project 1:SQL PROJECT 1](https://github.com/nafiya1236/SQL-projects/blob/main/hospital.sql)\
In this SQL project, I designed and implemented a hospital database consisting of tables for Patients, Doctors, and Appointments. The database stores key details such as patient and doctor information, specializations, and appointment schedules, with relationships established through primary and foreign keys. This project showcases my ability to create structured databases, define relationships, and manage healthcare-related data efficiently.\
**SQL project on Students**
[Project 2:SQL PROJECT 2](https://github.com/nafiya1236/SQL-projects/blob/main/student.sql)\
In this SQL project, I designed a student database with tables for Students, Courses, and Enrollments. The database stores student details, course information, and enrollment records, with relationships established using primary and foreign keys. This project demonstrates my ability to structure and manage educational data, track student-course relationships, and ensure data integrity for academic systems.\
